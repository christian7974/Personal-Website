# Personal Website

## Christian Tropeano

This is a personal website I made in order to showcase the work I have done while in college. 

## Inspiration

I wanted to make this website after taking a Udemy Course about web development. I felt that I had enough information in order to build a website and I used the course as a way to guide my through the process. 

## Currently Working On

One thing that I want to work on is to make my website responsive (look good on every device). I have been trying to make every section responsive on every device, however that has been very time consuming. I want to keep improving on that.  
I also want to continue to make my website more than a static website by adding animations to keep it fresh.

## Things I Would Do Differently

One thing that I would do differently would be to plan out what I would do in what order. I had the vision for my website (as seen in the prototypes folder), however I did not have the process planned out how I liked (I should have decided what sections I wanted to do first, what part of my website took priority, etc). While I am proud with how the website came out, planning out the steps would have allowed me to work on one section at a time rather than jump around.  
I also want to come up with a way where when someone would enter their email and comment under the Contact Me section and I would receive an email that had their email as well as what they had to say. I had to settle with using a database to do this, however this seems like an overkill. It also means that I have to check periodically to make sure I did not miss someone saying anything.


## Tools Used

- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap (CSS Framework)
- DOM (Document Object Model)
- Google Domains (to get the custom domain christiantropeano.com)
- Github Pages (to deploy my webpage)
- Google Firebase (to store the information that people could enter under the Contact Me section)
